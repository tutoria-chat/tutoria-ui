The TOKEN is the KEY that opens the door to that room! Each module can have MULTIPLE tokens (multiple keys) that you give to different groups of students.",
        "why": "WHY create tokens? Because you need a way to CONTROL who can access your module! You don't want the whole internet using your AI tutor - you only want YOUR students! Tokens also let you: 1) Control what students can do (chat only? or also download files?), 2) Set expiration dates (so the token stops working after the semester ends), 3) Track usage (see how many times the token was used).",
